In this blog post, I'm gonna show how to get a good enough syntax highlighting
for MDX files in Neovim.

We can get pretty far by just adding some queries to our configuration, using
the standard [Treesitter parser for markdown
(CommonMark)](https://github.com/MDeiml/tree-sitter-markdown) -- no need to
write a new parser, which is more challenging. Let's see how.

# Supporting `.mdx` files

First, let's configure `nvim` to use the `mdx` filetype for every file with the
`.mdx` extension:

```lua title="~/.config/nvim/filetype.lua"
vim.filetype.add({
  extension = {
    mdx = 'mdx'
  }
})
```

Then, let's configure the
[`nvim-treesitter`](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter/) plugin
to use the `markdown` parser for `mdx` filetypes:

```lua
local ft_to_parser = require("nvim-treesitter.parsers").filetype_to_parsername
ft_to_parser.mdx = "markdown"
```

Now we have markdown highlighting in our mdx files, but of cours it still
doesn't highlight any JS/JSX we wrote:

<ReactCompareSlider client:load>
  <ReactCompareSliderImage slot="itemOne" src={InitialHighlighting} alt="There is no syntax highlight of MDX files in Neovim out of the box" />
  <ReactCompareSliderImage slot="itemTwo" src={MarkdownHighlighting} alt="After configuring Treesitter to use Markdown highlight for MDX files" />
</ReactCompareSlider>

# Injecting JS/JSX into markdown

To highlight the JS/JSX part, we'll use Treesitter's [language
injection](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/syntax-highlighting#language-injection).

We do this by writing a Treesitter query to select the nodes in the tree we
want to highlight using another parser. It's similar to CSS selectors -- but it
has completely different syntax, a Scheme-like language.

## How can we write JavaScript/JSX in MDX?

We can write JavaScript inside curly braces, like this:

```mdx
The current year is {new Date().getFullYear()}
```

Lines beginning with with import/export are also interpreted as JavaScript:

```mdx
import {getCurrentYear} from './date.js'
export const currentYear = getCurrentYear()

# The current year is {currentYear}
```

We can write JSX anywhere, similar to how you can write HTML in Markdown.

```mdx
import {Box} from 'design-system'

<Box>
  Here's some text
</Box>
```

And even inline, inside of a heading:

```mdx
export const Thing = () => <>World</>

# Hello <Thing />
```

## Writing Treesitter queries

Let's first write a query to select those nodes that start with `import` or
`export`. We can get a nice representation of the abstract syntax tree built by
Treesitter with `:TSPlaygroundToggle` command, making it easy to see where the
text we want to select is in the tree: `section` -> `paragraph` -> `inline`:

<Note>

To use `:TSPlaygroundToggle`, you'll need to install the plugin
[`nvim-treesitter/playground`](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/playground)
first.

</Note>

<Image src={TSPlaygroundToggle} alt="" />

The simplest query that would match that node is:

```scheme
(section (paragraph (inline)))
```

<Image src={SimpleQuery} alt="" />

<Note>

To test your Treesitter queries, press `o` inside the buffer opened by
`:TSPlaygroundToggle` command, which will open a new buffer for you write an
your queries and see if selects what you want.

You'll need to install the Treesitter parser for query editor with `:TSInstall
query`.

</Note>

But that's not what we want -- we need to select only the nodes that start with
`import` or `export`. We can use Treesitter query predicates (see `:h
treesitter-predicates`) to conditionally select nodes -- for instance, the
`#match` predicate will allow us to select nodes with text that matches a Vim
regexp.

```scheme
((inline) @_inline (#match? @_inline "^\(import\|export\)"))
```

<Image src={ConditionalQuery} alt="" />

## Extending Treesitter injection queries

Now that we know this query correctly matches what we expect, we need to
highlight them as JavaScript.

For this, we'll have to write these queries in a file called `injections.scm`
in a `queries` directory in our runtime path (see [Adding
Queries](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter/#adding-queries)).

Then we need to capture the node with a name that matches the injected language
parser's name, in our case it's `tsx`:

```scheme title="~/.config/nvim/after/queries/markdown/injections.scm"
; extends
(((inline) @_inline) @injection.content
  (#match? @_inline "^\(import\|export\)")
  (#set! injection.language "tsx"))
```

<ReactCompareSlider client:load>
  <ReactCompareSliderImage slot="itemOne" src={MarkdownHighlighting} alt="" />
  <ReactCompareSliderImage slot="itemTwo" src={JavascriptHighlighting} alt="" />
</ReactCompareSlider>

# Disabling spell checking

You may have noticed the red squiggly lines -- this is because I have spell
checking turned on, but it is often not desirable to have our code spell
checked. We can disable it for a specific node by capturing it with `@nospell`
with a query in `highlights.scm`:

```scheme title="~/.config/nvim/after/queries/markdown/highlights.scm"
; extends
((inline) @_inline (#match? @_inline "^\(import\|export\)")) @nospell
```

<ReactCompareSlider client:load>
  <ReactCompareSliderImage slot="itemOne" src={JavascriptHighlighting} alt="" />
  <ReactCompareSliderImage slot="itemTwo" src={NospellHighlighting} alt="" />
</ReactCompareSlider>

# Conclusion

This is much better than what we started with, but there is still room for
improvements:

- JavaScript inside curly braces is not highlighted at all. I couldn't find a
  way to achieve this with language injection.
- Closing tags are not properly highlighted (because Treesitter sees a closing
  tag without a corresponding opening tag as an error).

I'm not sure if these issues could be resolved with queries alone -- maybe it'd
require a Treesitter parser similar to the parser for [embedded template
languages like
EJS](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-embedded-template).
