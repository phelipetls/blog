In this post, I want to share how I started to change [dwm](dwm.suckless.org/)
source code in order to improve my experience with Android Emulator.

First, let me briefly explain the problem. When you launch Android Emulator, a
window with the Android device and a window with buttons to control it appear
(maybe a modal window saying "Loading state..." too).

The device window is usually the one I'm mostly interested in. I don't recall
ever wanting to focus the other ones (except by interacting with the mouse) and
I don't want them to show up in the taskbar (since I use the
[`awesomebar`](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/awesomebar/) patch).

At first, I went in and modified the source code to ignore these windows by
their `WM_NAME` properties, which is easy to find out with `xprop`. But these
windows are very badly named and their names are not very distinct from the
device window.

Later I learned that these other windows are [*transient
windows*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transient_(computer_programming)) in
X11:

> A window is said to be transient for another window if it belongs to that
> other window and may not outlast it: a dialog box, such as an alert message,
> is a common example.

These windows have a property called
[`WM_TRANSIENT_FOR`](https://tronche.com/gui/x/icccm/sec-4.html#WM_TRANSIENT_FOR),
whose value we can get with an Xlib function named
[`XGetTransientForHint`](https://tronche.com/gui/x/xlib/ICC/client-to-window-manager/XGetTransientForHint.html).

Here's an example on how to use this function, taken from the [`dwm` source
code](https://git.suckless.org/dwm/file/dwm.c.html#l1038):

``` c {4-5,9-11}
void
manage(Window w, XWindowAttributes *wa)
{
	Client *c, *t = NULL;
	Window trans = None;

	// ...

	if (XGetTransientForHint(dpy, w, &trans) && (t = wintoclient(trans))) {
		c->mon = t->mon;
		c->tags = t->tags;
	} else {
		// ...
	}
}
```

As you can see, it's pretty simple, `XGetTransientForHint` assigns a `Window`
to the `trans` variable (if it succeeds), and then we get the respective
`Client` with the `wintoclient` function.

This example provided me with enough knowledge to solve most of my problems:

- I don't want them in the taskbar.
- I don't want them in the monocle layout count.
- I never want to focus them with the keyboard.
- When I apply the nth tag to the leader window, the same tag should be applied
  to its transient windows.
- On floating layout, if I focus on a leader window, I want its transient
  windows to be raised into view as well.

# Skipping transient windows in the taskbar

The taskbar is drawn by the `drawbar` function.

I just need to check if a window is transient and, if so, skip:

```c {10-11,21-22}
void
drawbar(Monitor *m)
{
	// ...
	Client *c, *t = NULL;
	Window trans;

	// ...
	for (c = m->clients; c; c = c->next) {
		if (ISVISIBLE(c) && !XGetTransientForHint(dpy, c->win, &trans))
			n++;
		// ...
	}

	// ...

	if ((w = m->ww - sw - stw - x) > bh) {
		if (n > 0) {
			// ...
			for (c = m->clients; c; c = c->next) {
				if (!ISVISIBLE(c) || XGetTransientForHint(dpy, c->win, &trans))
					continue;
				if (m->sel == c)
					scm = SchemeSel;
				else if (HIDDEN(c))
					scm = SchemeHid;
				else
					scm = SchemeNorm;
				drw_setscheme(drw, scheme[scm]);
				// ...
			}
		// ...
		}
	}
	// ...
}
```

We need to be careful here and also change the `buttonpress` function, which
handles clicks in the taskbar:

					else
						x += (1.0 / (double)m->bt) * m->btw;
```

Later, by investigating `xprop` output, I found that some windows give a hint
called `_NET_WM_STATE_SKIP_TASKBAR` so window managers shouldn't include them
in the taskbar, this seemed like a better idea too so [I implemented it as
well](https://github.com/phelipetls/dotfiles/commit/7333e85b50abc63da0193705d204cf40c19b63bc).

# Skipping transient windows in monocle layout count

This is simple, we just need to *not* increment a counter when the window is
transient, in the `monocle` function:

```c {5-6,9-10}
void
monocle(Monitor *m)
{
	unsigned int n = 0;
	Client *c;
	Window trans;

	for (c = m->clients; c; c = c->next)
		if (ISVISIBLE(c) && !XGetTransientForHint(dpy, c->win, &trans))
			n++;
	if (n > 0) /* override layout symbol */
		snprintf(m->ltsymbol, sizeof m->ltsymbol, "[%d]", n);
	// ...
}
```

# Do not focus transient windows with <kbd>mod</kbd> + <kbd>j</kbd> and <kbd>mod</kbd> + <kbd>k</kbd>

I started by checking which function is bound to these keys in `config.h`: the
`focusstack` function.

Then it's quick to realize I just need to add another condition to the various
if statements (careful not to mix up the `i` and `c` variables):

	}
```

# Applying nth tag to a leader window's transient windows

To achieve this, I also started by checking which function is bound to
<kbd>Mod</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>n</kbd> in `config.h`, which is the
`tag` function.

Then I modified it to apply the same tag to all transient windows whose window
leader is the selected client:

```c {10-16}
void
tag(const Arg *arg)
{
	Client *c, *t = NULL;
	Window trans = None;

	if (selmon->sel && arg->ui & TAGMASK) {
		selmon->sel->tags = arg->ui & TAGMASK;

		for (c = selmon->stack; c; c = c->snext) {
			if (XGetTransientForHint(dpy, c->win, &trans) && (t = wintoclient(trans))) {
				if (selmon->sel == t) {
					c->tags = arg->ui & TAGMASK;
				}
			}
		}

		focus(NULL);
		arrange(selmon);
	}
}
```

# Raising all transient windows when the leader window gets focused

Since the transient windows do not appear in the taskbar and we also ignore
them in the `focusstack` function, there is no way to focus on them if they're
not visible on the screen.

So in floating layout there's an usability problem: transient windows are never
visible.

The fix is to raise all transient windows when a window gets focused. Also,
if a transient window gets focused in a non-floating layout, we should raise it
as well since transient windows are always floating in dwm). Here's the code:

```diff

```

This create another problem though... When the leader window gets unfocused,
their transient windows would always reamin on top of everything else!

Thanks to [a comment by
/u/bakkeby](https://www.reddit.com/r/dwm/comments/sctdxt/comment/huaveje), I
found out that I could use
[`XLowerWindow`](https://tronche.com/gui/x/xlib/window/XLowerWindow.html) in
the `unfocus` function to fix this:

```c {12-19}
void
unfocus(Client *c, int setfocus)
{
	Client *i, *t;
	Window trans = None;

	if (!c)
		return;
	grabbuttons(c, 0);
	XSetWindowBorder(dpy, c->win, scheme[SchemeNorm][ColBorder].pixel);

	if (XGetTransientForHint(dpy, c->win, &trans))
		XLowerWindow(dpy, c->win);

	for (i = c->mon->stack; i; i = i->snext) {
		if (ISVISIBLE(i) && (XGetTransientForHint(dpy, i->win, &trans) && (t = wintoclient(trans)) && (t == c))) {
			XLowerWindow(dpy, i->win);
		}
	}

	if (setfocus) {
		XSetInputFocus(dpy, root, RevertToPointerRoot, CurrentTime);
		XDeleteProperty(dpy, root, netatom[NetActiveWindow]);
	}
}
```

<Warn>

This is pretty cutting-edge and coming from a person with
no expertise in C, so it might be broken in several ways. I'm just messing
around.
