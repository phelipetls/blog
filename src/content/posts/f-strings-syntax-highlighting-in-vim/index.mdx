Getting Python syntax highlighting to work in Vim requires very little code, to
my surprise.

<Note>

**UPDATE 2020-10-30**: First iteration of this post was very naive, supporting
only the very basic. See the
[diff](https://gist.github.com/phelipetls/8726d6cd68e66ad6b83586ae53f3b3d8/revisions#diff-8108a43d0db89a371349e6de001c6932fba065485f6790dddd5b011e7ae7f527)
that adds support for string modifiers and escape sequences.

Here is everything that you need and an explanation below.

```vim
" in ~/.config/nvim/after/syntax or ~/.vim/after/syntax
syn match pythonEscape +{{+ contained containedin=pythonfString,pythonfDocstring
syn match pythonEscape +}}+ contained containedin=pythonfString,pythonfDocstring

syn region pythonfString matchgroup=pythonQuotes
      \ start=+[fF]\@1<=\z(['"]\)+ end="\z1"
      \ contains=@Spell,pythonEscape,pythonInterpolation
syn region pythonfDocstring matchgroup=pythonQuotes
      \ start=+[fF]\@1<=\z('''\|"""\)+ end="\z1" keepend
      \ contains=@Spell,pythonEscape,pythonSpaceError,pythonInterpolation,pythonDoctest

syn region pythonInterpolation contained
      \ matchgroup=SpecialChar
      \ start=+{{\@!+ end=+}}\@!+ skip=+{{+ keepend
      \ contains=ALLBUT,pythonDecoratorName,pythonDecorator,pythonFunction,pythonDoctestValue,pythonDoctest

syn match pythonStringModifier /:\(.[<^=>]\)\?[-+ ]\?#\?0\?[0-9]*[_,]\?\(\.[0-9]*\)\?[bcdeEfFgGnosxX%]\?/ contained containedin=pythonInterpolation
syn match pythonStringModifier /![sra]/ contained containedin=pythonInterpolation

hi link pythonfString String
hi link pythonfDocstring String
hi link pythonStringModifier PreProc
```

# Declaring a syntax region for f-strings

The first two lines define a new syntax region (see `:h syn-region`) called
`pythonfString`.

We then declare how it starts with the regex `[fF]\@1<=\z(['"]\)`, which is
equivalent to `(?:<=[fF])(['"])` in Perl regular expressions (see `:h \@<=`).
The second line just handles the case of a docstring.

The string will end how it starts, so we can just reference the captured group
using `\z1` (we need to prefix it with `z` because it is an external pattern,
see `:h \z(`).

The `matchgroup` argument tells Vim which highlight group it should use to
highlight the start/end pattern. The group `pythonQuotes` come from the default
syntax file.

# Handling expressions inside f-strings

We also need to declare what this region contains.

For this we declare another region called `pythonInterpolation`, which starts
with `{` (but not with `{{`, which will actually produce a literal `{`) and
closes with `}`. With that in mind, we use the regex `{{\@!` because we don't
want a match if the preceding token is present (see `:h \@!`).

This region may contain only expressions, so stuff like a function declaration
does not make sense (notice there is a syntax for that, `:helpgrep ALLBUT`)

# Handling string modifiers

f-strings supports
[`str.format` syntax](https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#format-examples)
for formatting, for example:

```python
import math
print(f"The value of pi is approximately {math.pi:.3f}.")
```

So I read the
[Python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#format-specification-mini-language)
and wrote a regex based on it, but regexes are always easier to write than to
read so I wouldn't recommend you trying.

It's also possible to convert a value as if wrapping them in functions such as
`ascii()`, `repr()`, `str()` with `!a`, `!r`, `!s` respectively, so we need to
handle this also.

For this, I declared a syntax group with `:h syn-match` and pass the regexes
that should be used.

It should only be highlighted inside a `pythonInterpolation` so we take
advantage of the `containedin` argument (see `:h syn-containedin`).

# Highlighting declared groups

Finally, we link these new highlight groups with an appropriate/whichever you
like highlight group (see `:h hi-link` and `:h group-name`). I chose `String`
for f-strings and `PreProc` for modifiers. And it should work as expected.
