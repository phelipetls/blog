Debouncing a callback in a React component may not be as straightforward as you
might think. In this post I want to explore the source of this difficulty and
how to solve it.

# What is debouncing?

Debouncing a callback means delaying it to run after some time has passed from
the last user's request.

For example, it's useful to fetch search results after the user stopped typing
in the search input.

Here's an example of a button that runs a debounced callback on click:

<DebounceButtonExample client:visible shouldShowConsole debounceCode={debounceCode} />

The click handler callback calls `console.log` and you'll notice it takes 300ms
before it actually runs after the click. If you're fast enough in spamming
button clicks the `console.log` will only run 300ms after you stop.

# Naive implementation

Let's implement this example in React:

<DebounceReactNaiveButtonExample client:visible shouldShowConsole debounceCode={debounceCode} />

We can see that everything works just as fine as in the vanilla JavaScript
example.

But what could go wrong, exactly...? `debounce` is a higher-order function --
it accepts a function as argument and returns a new one. This returned function
is a closure, meaning it is a function that "closes over" its scope with a
variable that holds the last `setTimeout` return value, which we use later to
cancel the scheduled timeout with `clearTimeout`, in case the callback gets
called within the 300ms interval -- this is how we achieve the debounce effect
is produced.

In other words, the returned function depends on a *state* to do its job
properly:

```javascript {4,12}
export function debounce(func, duration) {
  console.log('Running debounce')

  let timeout

  return function (...args) {
    const effect = () => {
      timeout = null
      return func.apply(this, args)
    }

    clearTimeout(timeout)
    timeout = setTimeout(effect, duration)
  }
}
```

So this function needs to be stable across renders! We know that in React
functional components, this is not a given -- every function declaration will
result in a new function instance at every render, unless we use `useCallback`
or `useMemo`.

In this particular case, it's crucial to use these hooks to achieve the desired
user experience. Doing otherwise is what I'm calling the naive implementation.

Now, why does the button example work? Because the button example only renders
once since it has no state or parent components -- the debounced callback is
stable, it's the same exact function every time we click on the button.

We can start to expect buggy behavior once the debounced callback depends on a
value or state, such as in this example of filtering a list of films based on
user input:

<DebounceReactNaiveInputExample client:visible shouldShowConsole debounceCode={debounceCode} />

In this example, everything is broken, the filtering is not debounced -- this
is because our debounced function is not stable across renders.

# Implementation with `useCallback`

The fix is to wrap the `debounce` function call with `useCallback`:

<DebounceReactUseCallbackExample client:visible shouldShowConsole debounceCode={debounceCode} />

The only "problem" with this approach is that `debounce` will run on every
render, but we can deal with this by using `useMemo`.

# Implementation with `useMemo`

Using useMemo, the `debounce` function will be invoked only during the initial
render:

<DebounceReactUseMemoExample client:visible shouldShowConsole debounceCode={debounceCode} />
