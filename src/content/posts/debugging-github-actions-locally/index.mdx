title: Debugging GitHub actions locally in an interactive shell

It's not news that [`nektos/act`](https://github.com/nektos/act) works well to
debug GitHub actions locally, but I wanted the fast feedback loop of an
interactive shell instead of re-running `act push` each time I changed `echo`
commands in the workflow file.

Today was the first time that I resorted to `nektos/act` because usually it
isn't so difficult to reproduce CI-only errors locally in JavaScript projects,
but today it happened and I'm glad it exists.

Fortunately I had already installed Docker in my Fedora machine so I was spared
of this headache, but [I still needed to fix not being able to run it as a
non-root
user](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/#manage-docker-as-a-non-root-user):

```sh
sudo groupadd docker
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
newgrp docker

docker run hello-world
```

Once that was done, I started running the problematic action locally to start
debugging it:

```sh
act push
```

At first, I was adding `echo` commands to debug what I think would help me
understand the errors:

```yaml
name: Debug
run: echo "grep -C10 'export type CollectionEntry' ./.astro/content.d.ts"
```

But this workflow got tired fast since it's not so much faster than running it
on github.com itself, so I had the idea of getting into this Docker image after
a certain step, similar to a debugging breakpoint.

Nothing as such exists, naturally, but I asked Claude and it gave me an amazing
idea... to use `sleep`:

```yaml
name: Sleep
run: sleep 9999999999
```

Once the Docker container is sleeping, we can run `/bin/bash` to get access to
it! First, we need the Docker container, let's run `docker ps` to find it:

```sh
% docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                            COMMAND               CREATED          STATUS          PORTS     NAMES
43539276413c   catthehacker/ubuntu:act-latest   "tail -f /dev/null"   51 minutes ago   Up 51 minutes             act-Deploy-website-to-GitHub-Pages-on-push-deploy-222f0898354481efb0d5304069c913b76bf812924903a1f31f1e1000da84071f
```

Then we can hop into a Bash shell with the following command:

```sh
% docker exec -it 43539276413c /bin/bash
```

Now, I can run any commands or read any files without waiting for the whole
workflow to run! It's perfect.

Unfortunately, it does not have `vim` nor `emacs` neither `nano`, so it's
difficult to edit files but we still have "here documents":

```sh
% cat << EOF > myfile.json
{"foo":"bar"}
EOF
```

It is even possible to copy container files to the host machine to help
reproducing the errors -- that was how I ended up finding the fix:

```sh
% rm -rf .astro
% docker cp 43539276413c:/home/phelipe/Projetos/blog/.astro .
```

...In case you're wondering, it was a bunch of TypeScript errors of the type
`TS7006: Parameter 'xxx' implicitly has an 'any' type` that occurred only for
Astro-generated types, which explains my attempt to reproduce the errors by
copying the container `.astro` folder. Eventually, I discovered that the
problem was with my `tsconfig.json`, which was outdated according to Astro docs
recommendations:

```json
{
  "extends": "astro/tsconfigs/base",
  "include": [".astro/types.d.ts", "**/*"],
  "exclude": ["dist"]
}
```

I also learned that `tsconfig.json` files do not merge array values with the
extended `tsconfig.json` array values, which was the mistaken assumption that
kept me from fixing it faster.
