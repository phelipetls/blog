A polymorphic component is a design pattern that allows you to customize the
HTML tag used by a React component via props:

```jsx
<Typography as='label'>foo</Typography>
```

`Typography` is polymorphic because the generated HTML will be an actual HTML
`label` tag:

```html
<label>foo</label>
```

This is easy to do if we're just using JavaScript and do not care about
type-safety:

```tsx twoslash
import React from 'react'
// ---cut---
const Typography = ({ as: Component = 'span' }) => {
  return <Component />
}
```

It gets at lot more challenging if we want the component to be strongly-typed.

For instance, say we don't want to allow the consumer to pass props that
doesn't make sense for a specific HTML element -- a `span` HTML element is not
supposed to be passed a `for` attribute:

```tsx
// This should be fine
<Typography as="label" htmlFor='' />
// @ts-expect-error This shouldn't: htmlFor is not allowed in span elements
<Typography as="span" htmlFor="" />
```

So let's start typing this component.

<Note>

I wrote this blog post using TypeScript 4.9.5. Type errors may arise if you're
using later TypeScript versions.

</Note>

# Type-safe `as` prop

The `as` prop should only ever receive HTML tags like `span`, `div` etc.
Arbitrary string like `foo` should break the build:

```jsx
<Typography as='foo' />
```

What should be a type that accepts only valid HTML tags? Fortunately
`@types/react` already provides us with such a type: `React.ElementType`:

```tsx twoslash {1-3,5,11-12}
import React from 'react'
// ---cut---
type TypographyProps = {
  as?: React.ElementType
}

const Typography = ({ as: Component = 'span', ...rest }: TypographyProps) => {
  return <Component {...rest} />
}

// @errors: 2322
export default function App() {
  return <>
    <Typography as='foo' />
    <Typography as='div' />
  </>
}
```

# Polymorphic props with generic types

Now, we need to properly type the acceptable props based on the `as` prop. For
example, if `as` is `label`, we should be allowed to pass `htmlFor`. By default
the component will be a `span` element, so it should not accept `htmlFor`.

To do this, we will need to use a generic type:

```tsx twoslash {2,4-6,8-11}
import React from 'react'
// ---cut---
// TODO: implement PropsOf
type PropsOf<T> = {}

type TypographyProps<T extends React.ElementType> = {
  as?: T
} & PropsOf<T>

const Typography = <T extends React.ElementType = 'span'>({
  as,
  ...rest
}: TypographyProps<T>) => {
  const Component = as ?? 'span'
  return <Component {...rest} />
}
```

<Note>

**What is a generic type?**

A generic type is a function that takes an argument and returns a type.

Our argument, in this case, is `T` and it has a type constraint -- it needs to
extend (to be a subtype of) `React.ElementType`. So you can't pass an arbitrary
string: it needs to be a valid React element.

</Note>

Let's implement `PropsOf` now. We need a type that receives a valid React
element such as `button` or `label`, and returns an object with the element's
valid props.

Fortunately, there is a type already for this:
`React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef`.

```tsx twoslash {1,18-25}
import React from 'react'
// ---cut---
type PropsOf<T extends React.ElementType> = React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef<T>

type TypographyProps<T extends React.ElementType = React.ElementType> = {
  as?: T
} & PropsOf<T>

const Typography = <T extends React.ElementType = 'span'>({
  as,
  ...rest
}: TypographyProps<T>) => {
  const Component = as ?? 'span'
  return <Component {...rest} />
}

// @errors: 2322
export default function App() {
  return (
    <>
      {/* These should be ok */}
      <Typography data-foo='bar' />
      <Typography as="label" htmlFor="my-input" />

      {/* This should not, span elements don't accept htmlFor */}
      <Typography htmlFor="my-input" />
      {/* Neither this, div elements don't accept htmlFor */}
      <Typography as="div" htmlFor="my-input" />
    </>
  )
}
```

Fortunately, the current implementation already handles custom components --
just pass it to `as` and it should just work.

For instance, imagine we want to create a link using `Link` from
`react-router-dom` or `next/link`.

```tsx twoslash
import React from 'react'

type PropsOf<T extends React.ElementType> = React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef<T>

type TypographyProps<T extends React.ElementType = React.ElementType> = {
  as?: T
} & PropsOf<T>

export const Typography = <T extends React.ElementType = 'span'>({
  as,
  ...rest
}: TypographyProps<T>) => {
  const Component = as ?? 'span'
  return <Component {...rest} />
}

// ---cut---
// A mock Link component
function Link(props: { to: string }) {
  return <a href={props.to} />
}

// @errors: 2322
export default function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <Typography as={Link} to='#' />
      <Typography to='#' />
    </>
  )
}
```

# Adding component own props type

Now, let's say we want our `Typography` component to have their own props, such
as a `variant` prop. How should we do this while maintaining polymorphism?

We can do this by creating a new generic type, called `PolymorphicProps`, that
accepts the element type and the component own props as argument.

With these arguments, we will use the element type to get all props accepted by
that element's type plus the component own props, while also handling potential
conflicts between the two:

```tsx twoslash {3-18,31-32}
import React from 'react'
// ---cut---
type PropsOf<T extends React.ElementType> = React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef<T>

type PolymorphicProps<
  T extends React.ElementType = React.ElementType,
  TProps = {}
> = {
  as?: T
} & TProps &
  Omit<PropsOf<T>, keyof TProps | 'as'>

type BaseTypographyProps = {
  variant: 'heading' | 'paragraph'
}

type TypographyProps<T extends React.ElementType = 'span'> = PolymorphicProps<
  T,
  BaseTypographyProps
>

const Typography = <T extends React.ElementType = 'span'>({
  as,
  ...rest
}: TypographyProps<T>) => {
  const Component = as ?? 'span'
  // @ts-expect-error: FIXME this used to work in TypeScript 4.x but not anymore
  return <Component {...rest} />
}

export default function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <Typography variant="heading" data-foo="bar" />
      <Typography variant="paragraph" as="label" htmlFor="my-input" />
    </>
  )
}
```

The way we handle potential conflicts between the two is by using `Omit` type.
This will omit all props in the result of `PropsOf` that are also in `TProps`,
i.e. `TProps` will take precedence.

<Note>

In case you don't know,
[`Omit`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/utility-types.html#omittype-keys)
is a built-in [utility
type](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/utility-types.html). [You
can learn more about `Omit` in the TypeScript
docs.](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/utility-types.html#omittype-keys)

# Type-safe polymorphic refs

Now let's make our component `ref` props strongly-typed, conditional on the
`as` prop. Here's what I mean by this exactly:

```tsx
import { useRef } from 'react'
import { Typography } from './Typography'

export default function App() {
  const buttonRef = useRef<HTMLButtonElement>(null)

  return (
    <>
      {/* This should be fine */}
      <Typography as="button" ref={buttonRef} variant='paragraph' />
      {/* This should be a type error... */}
      <Typography as="label" ref={buttonRef} variant='paragraph' />
    </>
  )
}
```

Our component does not accept a `ref` prop yet. To do this, we need to change
the `PropsOf` type to use `React.ComponentPropsWithRef` instead of
`React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef`:

```tsx
type PropsOf<T extends React.ElementType> = React.ComponentPropsWithRef<T>
```

That's the easy part but, of course, we didn't forward any refs with that, we
actually need to use the
[`forwardRef`](https://react.dev/reference/react/forwardRef) function.

Unfortunately, that's where things start to get difficult -- the `forwardRef`
doesn't seem to be ergonomic enough to handle the polymorphic component case.

To illustrate this, let's see how we're supposed to type a non-polymorphic
component using the `forwardRef` with TypeScript:

```tsx twoslash {7}
import React from 'react'
// ---cut---
import { forwardRef, useRef } from 'react'

type TypographyProps = {
  variant: 'heading' | 'paragraph'
}

const Typography = forwardRef<HTMLSpanElement, TypographyProps>(
  (props, ref) => {
    return <span ref={ref} {...props} />
  }
)
```

As you can see, the function `forwardRef` is itself a generic function, taking
two arguments: the `ref` element's type and the component's props.

But this won't help... to achieve what we want, we would need to pass as first
argument a type that is conditional on the `as` prop value!

[The problem doesn't seem solvable unless we resort to type annotations/type
casting, as this article by Ben Ilegbodu
demonstrates.](https://www.benmvp.com/blog/forwarding-refs-polymorphic-react-component-typescript/)
So we essentially need to bypass the `React.forwardRef` types and define the
component types from scratch.

```tsx twoslash {1-12,23-25,27-37}
import React, { useRef } from 'react'

type PropsOf<T extends React.ElementType> = React.ComponentPropsWithRef<T>

type PolymorphicRef<T extends React.ElementType> =
  React.ComponentPropsWithRef<T>['ref']

type PolymorphicProps<
  T extends React.ElementType = React.ElementType,
  TProps = {}
> = {
  as?: T
} & TProps &
  Omit<PropsOf<T>, keyof TProps | 'as' | 'ref'> & { ref?: PolymorphicRef<T> }

type BaseTypographyProps = {
  variant: 'heading' | 'paragraph'
}

type TypographyProps<T extends React.ElementType = 'span'> = PolymorphicProps<
  T,
  BaseTypographyProps
>

type TypographyComponent = <T extends React.ElementType = 'span'>(
  props: PolymorphicProps<T, TypographyProps<T>>
) => JSX.Element | null

const Typography: TypographyComponent = React.forwardRef(
  <T extends React.ElementType = 'span'>(
    props: TypographyProps<T>,
    ref: PolymorphicRef<T>
  ) => {
    const { as, ...rest } = props

    const Component = as ?? 'span'
    return <Component ref={ref} {...rest} />
  }
)

// @errors: 2322
export default function App() {
  const buttonRef = useRef<HTMLButtonElement>(null)

  return (
    <>
      <Typography as="button" ref={buttonRef} variant="paragraph" />
      <Typography as="label" ref={buttonRef} variant="paragraph" />

      {/**
        * Apparently this is fine... because HTMLSpanElement implements the
        * HTMLElement interface, which the HTMLButtonElement inherits from.
        * @see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLSpanElement
        */}
      <Typography ref={buttonRef} variant="paragraph" />
    </>
  )
}
```
