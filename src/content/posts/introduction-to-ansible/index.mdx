A dotfiles repo will help you manage configuration over time and synchronize
them across machines, but it won't help you with your dependencies -- you still
have to install git, tmux, vim, etc. Let's see how Ansible can help with that.

Ansible would often come up as a solution to dependency management, but I'd
quickly dismiss it because it looked too complex and enterprise-y, an
impression that the [landing page](https://www.ansible.com) certainly
contributed to. In my opinion, It doesn't help convey the idea of what Ansible
turned out to be for me: a tool to automate tasks in a declarative way.

I wish I was introduced to Ansible differently, so this post is an attempt to
write the introduction I wish I've had. We'll deliberately abstract away the
more complex applications of Ansible and focus on solving one problem: how to
set up a machine with your preferred programs, appearances, settings etc.

# Installing Ansible

First things first, let's install Ansible. The official docs has an
extensive [list with installation instructions for many Unix-like operating
systems](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html#installing-ansible-on-specific-operating-systems).

<Warn>

[Ansible cannot run on a Windows
machine](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/windows_faq.html#windows-faq-ansible),
which is surprising. It can only *remotely manage* Windows machines, from a
Unix-like OS, such as WSL.

</Warn>

Another option, available at every operating system, is to use
[pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/), the package manager for Python, which was
my choice:

```shell
$ pip install ansible
```

# How Ansible clicked for me

If I remember correctly, it was by looking at the source code of a dotfiles
repo that used it. The `README.md` explained that you needed to run a one
single command to set up everything:

```shell
$ ansible-playbook --ask-become-pass bootstrap.yml
```

So I went and looked at what was going on at the `bootstrap.yml` file:

```yaml
- name: Bootstrap development environment
  hosts: localhost

  tasks:
  - name: Install packages with apt
    become: yes
    ansible.builtin.apt:
      name:
        - git
        - tmux
      state: present
```

Things immediately clicked for me once I saw it, like, it's clear that this is
using `apt` to download packages!

Of course, at this level, how is that much better than directly running `apt
install git tmux` in a shell script called, say, `bootstrap.sh`? In this
particular example, it's not much better but it's better already, as we'll see.
We're just getting started.

There's still a lot going on that we have to understand, e.g. what is `become`,
and `hosts`? But I think the terminology already shows what is Ansible's
primary goal: *to leave a machine in a desired state by playing a bunch of
tasks*. In this example, the desired state is to have git and tmux installed
(or "present"), but the desired state will likely not be that simple. Also,
what if we're on macOS? Or Fedora? We won't be able to use `apt` in this case.
We'll see that Ansible makes it easy to handle this.

# Playbook

The file `bootstrap.yml` is, in Ansible terminology, a
[playbook](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_intro.html),
which is, in my own words, a way to declare which tasks should run in a machine
in order to achieve the desired state. Playbooks are written in YAML, which is
easy to read and [learn](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/yaml/).

A playbook may contain various plays, and each play may contain various tasks.
For example, the `bootstrap.yml` playbook has a single play, named "Boostrap
development environment", with one task, "Install packages with apt".

# Hosts and inventory

Ansible can execute tasks on remote and local machines. This is managed with
the help of an
"[inventory](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/intro_inventory.html)",
where these machines (`hosts`) are classified with patterns like "prod",
"test", "webserver" etc..

We're not interested in that here since we just want to run tasks on our local
machine. Passing `localhost` as a playbook's `hosts` will do what we want,
without any inventory, because [Ansible will implicitly define `localhost` to
match the local
machine](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/inventory/implicit_localhost.html).

```yaml {2}
- name: Bootstrap development environment
  hosts: localhost
```

# Tasks

Now, let's dissect the "Install packages with apt" task. Here it is again:

```yaml
  tasks:
  - name: Install packages with apt
    become: yes
    ansible.builtin.apt:
      name:
        - git
        - tmux
      state: present
```

## Become

Let's start with the keyword
[`become`](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/become.html). It
is used so that you can "become another user while this task is executing",
that user being by default `root`. So it's, effectively, the equivalent of
using `sudo`. This is also why you need to run the playbook with the option
`--ask-become-pass` (`-K` for short), because it'll be necessary to prompt for
your password.

If you need to become another user other than `root`, use the `become_user`
keyword.

## Modules

`ansible.builtin.apt` is an [Ansible
module](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/modules_intro.html),
which is the preferred way to interact with another program in an Ansible
playbook.

Ansible has several built-in modules, [here's a full
list](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/index.html).
It has modules for most Linux distributions package managers, like
[`dnf`](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/dnf_module.html).
But there are also community-developed modules, like one for
[Homebrew](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/community/general/homebrew_module.html),
if you're on macOS, which we'll have to download separately, which we'll learn
how shortly.

An Ansible module takes arguments to accomplish a task. In the
`ansible.builtin.apt` case, we pass a list of packages to the
[`name`](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.9/modules/apt_module.html#parameter-name)
argument and the desired state we want them to be in to the
[`state`](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.9/modules/apt_module.html#parameter-state)
argument.

```yaml {4-8}
  tasks:
  - name: Install packages with apt
    become: yes
    ansible.builtin.apt:
      name:
        - git
        - tmux
      state: present # could also be 'latest' or 'absent'
```

## Idempotency

Ansible playbooks are meant to be idempotent, meaning that, no matter how many
times they run, the machine will end up in the same desired state.

An Ansible module can tell if something changed between runs. For example,
let's say I already have git and tmux installed and run the `bootstrap.yml`
playbook:

```shell {9-10}
$ ansible-playbook -K bootstrap.yml
BECOME password:

PLAY [Bootstrap development environment] *****************************************************************************

TASK [Gathering Facts] ***********************************************************************************************
ok: [localhost]

TASK [Install packages with apt] ******************************************************************************************
ok: [localhost]

PLAY RECAP ***********************************************************************************************************
localhost                  : ok=2    changed=0    unreachable=0    failed=0    skipped=0    rescued=0    ignored=0
```

The task "Install packages with apt" was labelled "ok", as in "nothing
changed": git and tmux were already present. If either were absent, the task
would have been labelled as "changed", because now both are present.

This feature is module-dependent. The task could be idempotent by nature, yet
Ansible wouldn't know about it unless the module is smart enough to tell it.

To illustrate this, let's use the
[`ansible.builtin.shell`](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/shell_module.html#shell-module),
which is used to run arbitrary commands into a shell. [Let's run a task using
this module in an ad hoc
way](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/intro_adhoc.html)
(outside of a playbook):

```shell
$ ansible localhost -m ansible.builtin.shell -a 'echo $SHELL'

[WARNING]: No inventory was parsed, only implicit localhost is available
localhost | CHANGED | rc=0 >>
/bin/bash
```

Ansible says something changed, but why? Running `echo $SHELL` cannot change
anything in a system (I guess?). But Ansible has no way to know this, since it
could be any arbitrary command, such as `rm -rf $HOME`.

Most of Ansible built-in modules are idempotent and smart enough to tell if
something changed between runs. `ansible.builtin.shell` is kind of a low-level
one, so it's best to avoid it whenever possible. There are ways to make it
smarter with parameters such as
[`creates`](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/shell_module.html#parameter-creates),
[`removes`](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/shell_module.html#parameter-removes),
or, at the task level,
[`changed_when`](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_error_handling.html#defining-changed).

# Facts and conditionals

Now let's imagine you use both macOS and Ubuntu. You want to install git and
tmux in both operating systems with Ansible. You'll need to add some sort of
conditional logic to your playbook since `apt` isn't available in macOS, and
you probably don't want to use Homebrew in Linux, even though you could.

[We can run a task conditionally with the `when`
keyword](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_conditionals.html#basic-conditionals-with-when):

```yaml {9, 19}
  tasks:
  - name: Install packages with apt
    become: yes
    ansible.builtin.apt:
      name:
        - git
        - tmux
      state: present
    when: ansible_distribution == "Ubuntu"

  tasks:
  - name: Install packages with brew
    become: yes
    community.general.homebew:
      name:
        - git
        - tmux
      state: present
    when: ansible_distribution == "MacOSX"
```

The task will run if the expression passed to `when` evaluates to `True`. This
expression is a Jinja2 expression, a template engine written in Python, so it's
not strictly Python syntax but it looks a lot like it.

The `ansible_distribution` variable is an [Ansible
fact](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_vars_facts.html):
information about your system gathered and provided by Ansible, for
convenience. There are a LOT of facts, you can run `ansible localhost -m
ansible.builtin.setup` to check what's available, but here's the [most commonly
used
ones](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_conditionals.html#commonly-used-facts):
`ansible_distribution`, `ansible_distribution_version` and `ansible_os_family`.

# Ansible Galaxy

The module `community.general.homebrew` is not a built-in module, you have to
install it separately via [Ansible Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/docs/),
which is a hub for Ansible content.

Ansible Galaxy provides a command-line interface to install stuff, like
[collections](https://galaxy.ansible.com/docs/contributing/creating_collections.html)
and roles (which we'll learn about shortly). `community.general` is a
collection of modules, which we can install by running:

```shell
$ ansible-galaxy collection install community.general
```

# Loops

You may need a loop to accomplish a task. For example, the following task will
build `dwm`, `slock` and `dmenu` from source, by running `sudo make install` in
each directory containing the source code:

```yaml
- name: Build and install suckless tools
  become: true
  loop:
    - dwm
    - slock
    - dmenu
  community.general.make:
    target: install
    chdir: "suckless/{{ item }}"
    make: /usr/bin/make
```

Another example is if a module do not accept a list of strings as an argument,
just a string.
[`community.general.npm`](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/community/general/npm_module.html)
is one of such modules. Here's an example of how to install some npm modules
globally:

```yaml {2-5, 7}
- name: Install npm global packages
  loop:
    - yalc
    - npm-merge-driver
    - diff-so-fancy
  community.general.npm:
    name: "{{ item }}"
    state: present
    global: true
```

# Jinja2

[Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/templates/) was mentioned
briefly in conditionals, but because it's a huge component of Ansible, it
deserves a few more words than that.

We've been using Jinja2 throughout this post already, e.g., `{{ item }}` is a
Jinja2 expression to expand the value in the variable `item`.

It's possible to manipulate this value with
[filters](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/templates/#filters), e.g.
`{{ item | upper }}`.

[There are a lot of built-in
filters](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/templates/#list-of-builtin-filters).
The `upper` filter is kind of an innocuous one, there are some more powerful,
e.g. `product` to build a [cartesian
product](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.8/user_guide/playbooks_filters.html#product-filters)
from lists:

```yaml {3-4, 7}
- name: Give users access to multiple databases
  community.mysql.mysql_user:
    name: "{{ item[0] }}"
    priv: "{{ item[1] }}.*:ALL"
    append_privs: yes
    password: "foo"
  loop: "{{ ['alice', 'bob'] | product(['clientdb', 'employeedb', 'providerdb']) | list }}"
```

Ansible uses [Jinja2
tests](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_tests.html#playbooks-tests)
to express conditional logic. The syntax for tests is slightly different than
the filter syntax:

```yaml {7}
vars:
  url: "https://example.com/users/foo/resources/bar"

tasks:
    - debug:
        msg: "matched pattern 1"
      when: url is match("https://example.com/users/.*/resources")
```

The usual [comparison
operators](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/latest/templates/#comparisons)
are available, like `==`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, and it's, of course, also
possible to [combine or transform multiple boolean
expressions](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/latest/templates/#logic) with
`and`, `or`, `not` etc.

# Roles

An Ansible role is a way to organize your tasks logic in a file structure. A
role is usually the format in which you use other people's Ansible tasks. For
example, [there is an Ansible role to install Visual Studio
Code](https://github.com/gantsign/ansible-role-visual-studio-code). It's
available in Ansible Galaxy, so we can install it like this:

```shell
$ ansible-galaxy role install gantsign.visual-studio-code
```

A role is usually customizable via parameters. For example, the
`gantsign.visual-studio-code` extension has a parameter that allows you to
install extensions:

```yaml {4-9}
    - role: gantsign.visual-studio-code
      users:
        - username: phelipe
          visual_studio_code_extensions:
            - "eamodio.gitlens"
            - "kahole.magit"
            - "PhilHindle.errorlens"
            - "sleistner.vscode-fileutils"
            - "vscodevim.vim"
```

In practice, creating a role is a matter of organizing things like tasks,
default variables, templates, files etc. in a file structure that Ansible can
understand.

You start by creating a `tasks/main.yml` file, which is the role's entry point,
from which all tasks will derive.

Let's check a role I made to install Neovim, to illustrate this:

```shell
$ tree roles/nvim
roles/nvim
└── tasks
    ├── fedora.yml
    ├── macos.yml
    ├── main.yml
    └── ubuntu.yml

1 directory, 4 files
```

The contents of `main.yml` simply import tasks from the other files, depending
on the host's operating system:

```yaml
- name: Build nvim from source in Ubuntu
  import_tasks: ubuntu.yml
  when: ansible_distribution == "Ubuntu"

- name: Build nvim from source in Fedora
  include_tasks: fedora.yml
  when: ansible_distribution == "Fedora"

- name: Install nvim with Homebrew in macOS
  import_tasks: macos.yml
  when: ansible_distribution == "MacOSX"
```

Ansible will make it easy for you to use templates and files stored in the
role's `templates` and `files` directory. You can provide variables' default
values in the `default/main.yml` file. The list could go on, but I won't go any
further. Learn more about it in the [official docs about
roles](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_reuse_roles.html).

# dotfiles use cases

Now let's look at some examples at how I used Ansible to manage [my
dotfiles](https://github.com/phelipetls/dotfiles).

## Building Neovim from source

Let's build Neovim from source with Ansible, in Ubuntu, with the help of the
[official guide](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Building-Neovim).

<Note>

I say Ubuntu because Fedora and Homebrew usually have an up-to-date Neovim
stable, so I can't be bothered.

</Note>

I already have Neovim source code as a git submodule in `deps/neovim`, but it's
also possible to add a task to clone its repository with the
[`ansible.builtin.git`](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/git_module.html)
module.

We'll need to install build dependencies, run some `make` commands, and that's
it!

```yaml
# In case you don't like git submodules
- name: Clone nvim repository
  git:
    repo: https://github.com/neovim/neovim
    dest: "{{ ansible_env.HOME }}/src/nvim"
    clone: true
    version: "v6.0.0"

- name: Install nvim build dependencies
  become: true
  apt:
    name:
      - ninja-build
      - gettext
      - libtool
      - libtool-bin
      - autoconf
      - automake
      - cmake
      - g++
      - pkg-config
      - unzip
      - curl
    state: present

- name: Build nvim release version
  community.general.make:
    chdir: deps/neovim
    params:
      CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE: Release

- name: Install nvim release version
  become: true
  community.general.make:
    chdir: deps/neovim
    target: install
```

## Installing efm-langserver

[`efm-langserver`](https://github.com/mattn/efm-langserver) is a Language
Server to make any LSP client understand the output of an arbitrary linter or
formatter.

Let's install it using Ansible too! It's a Golang app, so we could use the Go
toolchain to install it, but I had too much trouble going down this path, so
now I just download the tarball from GitHub, unpack (with
`ansible.builtin.archive` module) it and put the binary into my `PATH` (in
`$HOME/.local/bin`):

```yaml
- name: Create directory ~/.local/bin/
  file:
    path: "{{ ansible_env.HOME }}/.local/bin"
    state: directory

- name: Install efm-langserver in Linux
  unarchive:
    src: https://github.com/mattn/efm-langserver/releases/download/v0.0.37/efm-langserver_v0.0.37_linux_amd64.tar.gz
    dest: "{{ ansible_env.HOME }}/.local/bin"
    remote_src: true
    extra_opts:
      - "--strip-components=1"
      - "efm-langserver_v0.0.37_linux_amd64/efm-langserver"
  when: ansible_distribution == "Ubuntu" or ansible_distribution == "Fedora"
```

[It isn't as easy to do this in macOS
though](https://github.com/phelipetls/dotfiles/blob/d10072c4ab01d02018f5caeb1510d3c6c0ebbd95/roles/efm-langserver/tasks/macos.yml),
just because it's a zip file instead, which lacks the convenience of the
`extra_opts` parameter... But I might be missing something.

## Installing linters and formatters

I also install the linters and formatters I use with Ansible. Here's a snippet
of it:

```yaml
- name: Install linters and formatters with dnf
  become: true
  dnf:
    name:
      - ShellCheck # this is shellcheck in apt and brew
    state: present
  when: ansible_distribution == "Fedora"

# ...

- name: Install linters and formatters with pip
  ansible.builtin.pip:
    name:
      - flake8
      - black
      - yamllint
      - git+https://github.com/Vimjas/vint@master
    state: present
    executable: pip3

- name: Install linters and formatters with npm
  loop:
    - eslint_d
    - prettier
  community.general.npm:
    name: "{{ item }}"
    global: true
    state: present
```

[If you're interested, you can look at the file on
GitHub](https://github.com/phelipetls/dotfiles/blob/d10072c4ab01d02018f5caeb1510d3c6c0ebbd95/roles/efm-langserver/tasks/main.yml#L21-L62).

## Stow

Stow is a huge part of dotfiles management: it's responsible to put the
contents of my dofiles into my `$HOME` directory, as symlinks, while preserving
the same folder structure.

I also install and run Stow in my playbook. There isn't an Ansible module for
Stow though, so I have to resort to `ansible.builtin.shell`, which isn't great
because it's dumb. But not all is lost, we can make it smarter by tweaking the
task parameters. We can determine if something changed between runs by running
Stow in verbose mode (`--verbose=2`), to make it describe everything it did,
and then analyze its output.

```
stow dir is /home/phelipe/dotfiles
stow dir path relative to target /home/phelipe is dotfiles
Planning stow of package ....
--- Skipping .profile as it already points to dotfiles/.profile
Planning stow of package .... done
Processing tasks...
```

By looking at the output, we see that Stow says it skipped a file if there is
already a symlink for it in `$HOME`. But in the case there isn't, it'll say it
linked that file, like so:

```
LINK: .profile => dotfiles/.profile
```

So if the string `LINK` is in the stderr, it means a symlink was created,
something changed:

```yaml {8}
- name: Run stow
  shell: "stow . --target {{ ansible_env.HOME }} --verbose=2"
  register: result
  changed_when: 'result.stderr is search("LINK: ")'
```

This is a small thing, but it's just nice to run a playbook and have everything
labelled as "ok".

# GNOME

We can't customize GNOME with configuration files. We normally configure it
with GUIs, which is not a great thing if we're interested in automating the
customization step.

Fortunately, there is a command line interface to make this possible called
[`dconf`](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/dconf) (there's also `gsettings` but
we won't use it). The collection `community.general` has a [module for
`dconf`](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/community/general/dconf_module.html),
so let's use it.

For now, I just made two tweaks to my GNOME DE:

- Click by tapping on the touchpad.
- Show battery percentage next to the battery icon.

Here are the equivalent tasks:

```yaml
- name: Enable tap to click on touchpad
  community.general.dconf:
    key: "/org/gnome/desktop/peripherals/touchpad/tap-to-click"
    value: "true"

- name: Show battery percentage
  community.general.dconf:
    key: "/org/gnome/desktop/interface/show-battery-percentage"
    value: "true"
```

But how did I find that I needed this specific key
`/org/gnome/desktop/peripherals/touchpad/tap-to-click`? That's the hard part,
but it's easier if we use
[`dconf-editor`](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/DconfEditor), a GUI to explore
GNOME applications' internal settings. Navigate through it until you find the
desired setting that seems responsible for what you want, grab its path and
pass the value you want to it.

# Conclusion

You should now be able to automate downloading your favorite programs with your
preferred configuration across operating systems, with tasks/roles written by
you or by the community (which is the nicest part).

The next step should be to test if it really works by using a virtual machine
-- the Vagrant and Virtual Box combo seems to be a popular choice.

It's not wise to assume that your playbook will work on a fresh machine because
you might be relying on a dependency your playbook does not ensure it's true,
even though it is in your current host.
